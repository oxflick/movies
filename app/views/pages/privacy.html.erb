			<p>Last Updated:  August 29, 2014 </p>
			<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
			<p> 1.1. Purpose of Policy  </p>
			<p> Welcome to www.funkyflick.com (the "Site").  FunkyFlick, Inc. ("FunkyFlick," “we” or "us")  is committed to respecting the privacy rights of patrons, customers, visitors, and other users of the Site ("Users").  We created this Privacy Policy (this "Policy") to give you confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy.  This Policy is only applicable to the Site, and not to any other web sites that you may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same meaning given them in the funkyflick.com Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”). </p
				<p> </p>
				<p> 1.2. Notice Concerning Children </p>
				<p>We are a general audience site intended for adolescents and adults, and do not direct any of our content or services at minors under 13 years of age. We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children's privacy online. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site User is under 13 years of age, we will promptly take any action we may deem appropriate, including without limitation conducting further inquiry/investigation and/or deleting that User's account.  </p>
				<p> 2. INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES</p>
				<p> 2.1. What Basic Information Do We Collect? </p>
				<p> In operating the Site, we may include registrations, surveys, questionnaires and other online forms that ask Users to provide their names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and other contact information, credit card or other payment information for purchases, as well as profile information, ratings, reviews, text, audio, images and videos you submit, if any. </p>
				<p> 2.2. What Additional Information Do We Collect? </p>
				<p>(a) Automatic Collection. Our servers automatically recognize visitors' IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet), Internet service provider, browser type, computer platform, referring web site, date and time of access, links clicked through, and possibly other information as well. No personal information about you is revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but that may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. </p>
				<p> (b) Cookies. We use the standard "cookie" feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to our Site. If you create an account on our Site, we may store identifying information in a cookie on your computer so that the Site remembers you. Cookies also help us learn which areas of our Site are useful and which areas need improvement.  This Policy only covers use of cookies by FunkyFlick itself, and does not cover use of cookies by third parties, e.g., Site advertisers, who may also employ cookies through our Site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies once such third parties have been given permission to set cookies. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.  We may also adopt newer technologies serving some of the same functions as cookies (including by way of example only, and not of limitation, HTML 5 local storage) from time to time. <p>
					<p> 3.  USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION </p>
					<p>3.1. What Does FunkyFlick.com Do With Collected Information?</p>
					<p> (a) Personal Information. We will not share your personal information with any third parties without your consent, except as necessary or appropriate to provide you with our services or to comply with the law.  We may use your personal information to verify your identity or to follow up with transactions initiated on the Site. We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Site, to send you additional information about FunkyFlick and/or the Site, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you from time to time. </p>
					<p> (b) Anonymous Information. We use anonymous information to analyze our Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and Site activity information may also be shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate and anonymous basis. </p>
					<p> (c) Use of Cookies. We may use cookies (and other technologies having similar functions, such as HTML 5 local storage) to deliver content specific to your interests, to remember you when you return to the Site, or for other purposes. Promotions or advertisements displayed on our Site may also contain cookies (or technologies with similar function). We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our Site. </p>
					<p> (d) Disclosure of Personal Information. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on FunkyFlick or its affiliates, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of FunkyFlick or of Site Users, or (iii) act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of Site Users or the public at large. </p>
					<p> (e) Sale of Assets. In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through the Site. If FunkyFlick or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the assets transferred to the acquirer. </p>
					<p> (f) Access to Information / Opting-Out. Users may opt-out of receiving certain types of communications in the user account settings. </p>
					<p> 4. SECURITY </p>
					<p> The Site has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but all such security measures are imperfect (alas), and we can therefore make no assurances to you or to any third party regarding the foregoing. </p>
					<p> 5. SITE AREAS BEYOND OUR CONTROL </p>
					<p> 5.1. Public Forums </p>
					<p> The Site may include interactive forums for the exchange of information, ideas and opinions. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information.</p>
					<p> 5.2. Third Party Web sites </p>
					<p> The Site may contain links to other web sites. If you choose to visit other web sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those other web sites, and it is your responsibility to review the privacy policies at those web sites to confirm that you understand and agree with their policies. </p>
